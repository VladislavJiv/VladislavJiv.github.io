Hello everyone! 
This mini project was developed as part of a university assignment. Initially, the task required creating a basic HTML page. However, I decided to enhance the project by incorporating additional CSS styles to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
The project includes:
HTML Structure: A simple webpage layout with headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
CSS Styling: Custom styles applied to improve the overall look and feel of the webpage. This includes background colors, text colors, link styles, and layout adjustments to create a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing design.
This enhanced version of the project demonstrates my ability to apply CSS to a foundational HTML structure, showcasing both my understanding of web development and my commitment to creating a polished final product.
